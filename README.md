# United-Nations-Sustainable-Development-Goals-2021

## Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, are a collection of seventeen interlinked objectives adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. 
I created a custom theme using the color palette of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [https://unstats.un.org/sdgs]

## Dataset 
The data is from the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, specifically focusing on the indicators they are measuring. This visualization uses 3 datasets.
1.	SDG Indicator Data.
2.	Color palette and image info.
3.	json theme file.

## Data Visualization
1.	 Using the Hex Color Picker browser extension [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hex-color-picker/eamkimleiebmdpifljjfilhbaehclahg/related?hl=en ] 
for Chrome, I gathered the hex codes for each of the 17 SDGs,and was able to create a custom theme.
2. I used the PowerBI.Tips theme generator [https://themes.powerbi.tips/themes/palette] to start my template. [insert picture of color palette]
3. Downloaded the JSON file and uploaded it to the Power BI desktop.
4. Gathered URLs for the images I used in my report.  
•	I got the URL for each of the SDG icons for the primary image, and then I grabbed a secondary image directly from the PDF annual report
•	I used postimages.org to turn screenshots into image URLs.
5. Then I set the data type of my image columns to Image URL.
6. Using the Collage by Cloudscope custom visual for my Goal selector and the Simple Image custom visual for my secondary image (the large image associated with each goal) and custom formatting to make the background colors match the color associated with the SDG goal.
