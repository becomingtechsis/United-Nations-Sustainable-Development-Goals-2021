# United-Nations-Sustainable-Goals-2021
Introduction
I created a custom theme using the color palette of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [https://unstats.un.org/sdgs ]

Data 
This visualization uses 3 datasets. I used only the SDG indicator dataset.
1.	the first is the indicator data for the SDGs
2.	the second is the color palette and image info
3.	And a third option dataset.  the json file I created.

Visualize Data
1.	 Using the  Hex Color Picker browser extension 
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hex-color-picker/eamkimleiebmdpifljjfilhbaehclahg/related?hl=en ] 
for Chrome to gather the hex codes for each of the 17 SDGs, I was able to create a custom theme in Power BI. Afterwards, I used 
PowerBI.Tips theme generator [https://themes.powerbi.tips/themes/palette] to start my template.

2.	 Import your json theme file into the Power BI desktop.

3.	Gather URLs for images you’d like to use in your report
•	I got the URL for each of the SDG icons for the primary image, and then I grabbed a secondary image directly from the PDF annual report
•	I used postimages.org to turn screenshots into image URLs
4.	Then I set the data type of my image columns to Image URL
5.	Design your report!
•	I used the Collage by Cloudscope custom visual for my Goal selector and the Simple Image custom visual for my secondary image (the large image associated with each goal)
•	I used custom formatting to make the background colors match the color associated with the SDG goal. Play around with that if you like!
